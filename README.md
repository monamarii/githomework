Hi, are you looking for the other side?

### 2025-11-22
Feel like nothing ever seems quite right?

### 2025-11-23
Are you circling the drainpipe, getting off on pain like you're corrupted?

### 2025-11-24
I need to know where your loyalties lie

### 2025-11-25
Tell me, are you gonna bark or bite?

### 2025-11-26
Do you really wanna twist a knife in the belly of the monster?

### 2025-11-27
Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up

### 2025-11-28
Wipe the system and back the fuck up

### 2025-11-29
You're a puppet, when they cut your strings off

### 2025-11-30
Don't comе crawling back

### 2025-12-01
Kingslayer, destroying castles in thе sky

### 2025-12-02
Kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye

### 2025-12-03
I'd sacrifice my life to find you, angel of the blade

### 2025-12-04
Kingslayer, come and collect us from the night
